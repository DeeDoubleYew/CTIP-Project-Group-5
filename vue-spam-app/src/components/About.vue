        This application is a Vue 3 project developed as part of a university
        assignment for COS30043 at Swinburne University. It demonstrates the use
        of modern web technologies such as Vue.js, Vue Router, Bootstrap, and
        client-side pagination. The site features a home page, an about section,
        and a news page that dynamically loads and paginates news items,
        providing users with an interactive and responsive experience.
